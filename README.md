# Basic Calculator

## The assignment

Use Scene Builder and Intellij to build a basic calculator using Java and JavaFX.  The Calculator should display text at the top that says [your name]'s Calculator, followed by the display and then the normal keypad layout.  See image below.

I was able to create this with simple Layouts and elements we used in class for the tip calculator example but you are welcome to use any elements you wish from Scene Builder.

The starter code for this assignment is the example JavaFX template generated by Intellij with the file and class names changed to Calculator.  Replace the CalculatorController and Calculator.fxml with the files and examples you create in Scene Builder then wire up the Controller so the calculator works as you would expect a calculator to.  AC is for "All Clear" and C just clears the current entry.
